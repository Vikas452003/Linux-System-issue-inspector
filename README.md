# Linux-System-issue-inspector
A shell script which inspects primary system checks for daily production issues.

This project is a menu-driven shell script designed to help system administrators quickly detect and resolve common production issues. Instead of manually checking logs, services, or system resources, this script provides an interactive menu that automates routine tasks and displays results instantly.

Production environments often face recurring challenges:
-> Disk space running out due to growing logs
-> Services crashing or not installed
-> Backups failing or missing directories
-> Difficulty monitoring CPU/memory usage in real time
-> Log files growing uncontrollably

This script acts as a lightweight production helper tool, automating routine fixes and reducing downtime.
